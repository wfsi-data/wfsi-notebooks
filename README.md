# wfsi-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks and other example scripts for the Wildland Fire Science Initiative (WFSI) Data Portal project.

## Sonic Dataset Demo

The Sonic Dataset Demo illustrates what could be possible acquiring data from a future WFSI repository. A flmd (File-Level Metadata) file provides programitic navigation of the dataset. Data Dictionaries describe the data files. In the demo, sonic data is acquired from the 10x10 dataset, summary statistics calculated, and several plots generated based on user specifications.

To run the Jupyter notebook, nagivate to the directory containing the notebook and run:

    $ jupyter notebook

From the directory that opens in your browser, select the notebook: sonic_dataset_demo.ipynb
